### Howdy! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Cassandra Jacobs (they/any), and I am an assistant professor at the University at Buffalo and director of the [CaLiCo Lab](https://github.com/calicolab).  My interests lie in behavioral and computational psycholinguistics, with a healthy dash of methods for improving the humanlikeness and linguistic validity of natural language processing methods. Most of my repositories are for lab-internal projects, but as a believer in open science, you will see more open source software releases as the projects become more mature.
